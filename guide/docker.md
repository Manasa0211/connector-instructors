# A short guide to docker

It would be great if the docker instructions could indicate how to
- How to install docker (see https://github.com/data-8/data8-notebook)
- update docker (it asks me every day to update, should I?)
- update the data8 files in docker (how to keep in sync with any changes to the repo?)
- stop and restart or just run in the background docker.
- who to contact with questions/problems and how - email? slack? github issue?

# FAQ
If you have a question that isn't answered here or in the guide, either open an issue in this repository, ask on the Slack chatroom, or email the connector assistants.

**Q: Where can I find old materials for this course?**
    
> A: See http://data8.org/fa15/ for the set of materials from Fall 2015. It contains links to topics covered, sample notebooks, homeworks, etc.

**Q: Where can I find some example notebooks?**
    
> A: **Example notebooks:** For examples of notebooks, you can see
the [table demos][demos] or find all raw notebooks for the textbook [here](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/tree/gh-pages/notebooks). The main class uses notebooks for lectures, labs, and projects.

**Q: How can I more closely follow the class material?**
    
> A: Most of the material will mimic the previous semesters of Data8. However, some material will change (at least in timing if not in content). Those decisions will be made by John close to real time. The best bet is to look at the outline from the syllabus and then find the corresponding sections in [the textbook](http://www.inferentialthinking.com) to see how the material is covered. The textbook is basically the lecture notes from last semester.

**Q: What should I do if students want to join my connector without taking data8**
    
> A: There aren't going to be any "official" course resources for teaching people python/notebook/etc skills if they aren't enrolled in the main data 8 course. If the student has previously taken data8, then it shouldn't be a problem. If they have not taken data8, then:

> A. Remind them that the main course is a pre/co-requisite for any connector. (aka it is generally discouraged)

> B. If they really want to join, then the instructor can make a personal choice whether to include them. We'd recommend that you give some kind of personal assessment, written exam, etc to make sure that it won't create a lot of extra work for the instructor.

This documentation is for a collection of code that aims to be useful for connector instructors. 

If you have questions about the class, finding students, building your course, etc, check out the wiki [here](https://github.com/data-8/connector-instructors/wiki).

# Overview

Currently, this repository contains three main folders:

1. `/connectortools`: A python module that has some useful functions for using Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub in your classes. This is in the `connectortools` folder and can be installed with the `setup.py` script.
2. `/examples`: A collection of examples for how to use `connectortools`. 
3. `/tutorials`: A collection of general tutorials that cover topics in programming, computation, etc. Connector instructors may find these useful in teaching basic concepts, and are encouraged to copy/modify them however they'd like.

# Interactive notebooks
## Using Data8
We've created an interact link for this repository [here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?repo=connector-instructors&path=*). Click it, and it will copy everything in this repo into your own `datahub` instance. You can then run the tutorials and examples from there.

## Using Binder
Alternatively, you can use `mybinder` to demo this code. This is a free service put together by the Freeman lab. If you're interested in running the tutorials or examples within Binder, click the image below to enter an interactive browsing session.

If you have a suggestion for something to add, open an issue in this repository and we can try to do so!

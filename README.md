This documentation is for a collection of code that aims to be useful for connector instructors. If you have questions about the class, finding students, building your course, etc, check out the wiki [here](https://github.com/data-8/connector-instructors/wiki).

# Overview

Currently, this repository contains three main things:

1. A python module, called `connectortools` that has some useful functions for using Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub in your classes. This is in the `connectortools` folder and can be installed with the `setup.py` script.
2. A collection of examples for how to use `connectortools`, these are notebooks in the `examples` folder. 
3. A folder (`tutorials`) with general tutorials that cover topics in programming, computation, etc. Connector instructors may find these useful in teaching basic concepts, and are encouraged to copy/modify them however they'd like.

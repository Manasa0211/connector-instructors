# Getting Started as a Connector Instructor
This repository contains three main things:

1. A python module, called `connectortools` that has some useful functions for using Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub in your classes. This is in the `connectortools` folder and can be installed with the `setup.py` script.
2. A collection of examples for how to use `connectortools`, these are notebooks in the `examples` folder. 
3. A collection of information for teaching data8 connector courses. This is currently in this `README.md` file as well as in the `guide` folder (all can be viewed on Github.com)
4. A folder (`tutorials`) with general tutorials that cover topics in programming, computation, etc. Connector instructors may find these useful in teaching basic concepts.

## Quick Links

* [Workflow](guide/workflow.md) describes how to create, distribute, and collect class materials with jupyterhub
* [FAQ](guide/faq.md) contains commonly-asked questions from connector instructors.
* [Resources](guide/resources.md) has information about computational resources in data8

## Points of contact

**Sam Lau** (samlau95@gmail.com) and **Chris Holdgraf** (choldgraf@berkeley.edu) are your current points of contact about issues and questions you may have as a connector instructor. Email us with questions or [ping us on slack][slack].

## Who is this for?

These guides are intended for connector instructors interested in creating
material that utilizes the same infrastructure as the main course.

Specifically, if you would like to use [**Jupyter notebooks**][ipython] and
optionally the [**`datascience`**][datascience] package in your course, this
guide is for you. Follow the links above to find this information.

[ipython]: http://ipython.org/notebook.html
[datascience]: https://github.com/data-8/datascience

If you do not want to use this infrastructure that's fine by us. We'd be happy
to help you in whatever capacity we can.

## Setup

If you run into issues or questions with any of these steps, contact Sam or
Chris with your issue(s). It's our responsibility to make sure you have access
to the needed websites.

You'll need an account on https://data8.berkeley.edu/ . You should be able to
log in to that site with your @berkeley.edu email address. If you run into a:

This means that you don't have access yet. Ping either Sam or Chris.

You'll also need an account on [Github][github] and the ability to push to the
Github repo associated with your connector course.

[Github][github] is a website that hosts code and files. A repository on Github
holds the files for a specific project. Each connector class has a repository.
If you don't know what your repository is, contact Sam.
